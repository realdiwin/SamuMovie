# SamuMovie

This project is a fork of the original SamuMovie project, and it is used for an exercise of the High Level Programming Languages 1 course.

[Original SamuMovie project](https://github.com/nbatfai/SamuMovie) repository

This is a video converter, which transforms the given input video(avi) into arrays(boolean).

Tutors: Simkó Szilárd Viktor, Gyulai Alex

Usage:
./SamuMovie
Click "Open the file"
Select the video file from the dialog
It will be automatically converted.
Click "Launch samu"

[Samu](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02889) (Nahshon) has captured a movie. 
This is an example of the manuscript entitled "Samu in his prenatal development".

This project uses the same COP-based Q-learning engine as Samu ([Nahshon](https://github.com/nbatfai/nahshon)) 
to predict the next sentences of a conversation. 

After the basic work on the [joining](https://github.com/nbatfai/SamuLife) 
of Conway's Game of Life and Samu's COP engine is done, 
now I have started to work on creating a similar but much simpler example 
in which Samu must learn the frames of the moving picture.

## Usage

### v0.0.1

```
git clone https://github.com/nbatfai/SamuMovie.git
cd SamuMovie/
~/Qt/5.5/gcc_64/bin/qmake SamuLife.pro
make
./SamuMovie
```

### v0.0.2-predicting-the-present-eliminated

It is important to note that in the previous version the COP-based Q-learning 
has become trivial because after a short starting period it chooses the Q-action 
that was passed in as the actual cell state argument. It means that the agent 
does not predict the future but the present. This version has already been 
improved. It really predicts the future. It can be verify in [SamuLife](https://github.com/nbatfai/SamuLife)
