# SamuMovie
[Samu](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02889) (Nahshon) has captured a movie. 
This is an example of the manuscript entitled "Samu in his prenatal development".

This project uses the same COP-based Q-learning engine as Samu ([Nahshon](https://github.com/nbatfai/nahshon)) 
to predict the next sentences of a conversation. 

After the basic work on the [joining](https://github.com/nbatfai/SamuLife) 
of Conway's Game of Life and Samu's COP engine is done, 
now I have started to work on creating a similar but much simpler example 
in which Samu must learn the frames of the moving picture.

## Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/nbatfai/SamuMovie.git
cd SamuMovie/
~/Qt/5.5/gcc_64/bin/qmake SamuLife.pro
make
./SamuMovie
```
